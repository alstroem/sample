# Sample

This app uses the device sensors to display weather/environment related data.

Using the Android sensor manager, it can collect temperature and humidity values, and persist the readings using a Room database on the device.
All the readings can then be seen in a list, and show a detailed view of the readings.

The app is build with a modulised approach, following the CLEAN architecture patterns.
